# photocrate
photocrate was a photo editing software I wrote when I was 14.
==============================================================
The project used a blend of HTML5, javascript and css. While It was a big project for me at the time, the layout of this project is very sloppy.

The code is all contained within one html file, including the javascript, which made things confusing. 

the color pallet resulted in over 600 lines of code that could have been as short as 50 had I decided to use arrays.

While the final version of this app was not the cleanest nor the most efficient (in terms of code), I am still proud of it since it was my first big project leaving middle school/entering high school.
